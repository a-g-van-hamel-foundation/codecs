<note type="comment">In this digital edition we have used Mac Airt &amp; Mac Niocaill's edition (1983) of the annals. We have omitted their edition (pp 2&ndash;36) of the Pre-Patrician or Irish World-Chronicle which is best treated as a separate text. Their edition extends from AD 431 to AD 1131.2 when both manuscripts become lacunose. For the remainder of the text (AD 1155 to the end) we have had to use Mac Carthy's very unsatisfactory edition. His codicological information is obscure, his citation of variants is patchy, and he makes many unnecessary or wrong-headed attempts at emendation. These latter are simply ignored, but emendations and corrections by <name id="WS">Whitley Stokes</name> (1896, 1897) are integrated into the text. It is not, however, possible to produce a satisfactory digital edition from Mac Carthy's ragged apparatus. The current edition contains only the text from AD 431 to AD 1201. The remainder of volumes 2 and 3 is in preparation.</note>

MS (ii) is a fair copy of MS (i) but with supplementary entries, and it preserves some text lost by mutilation in MS (i) as detailed above. Lacunae: 1131.3&ndash;1155, 1307&ndash;15.

<p>The present electronic text represents pages 38-578 of the edition
of Mac Airt and Mac Niocaill and pages 2-236 of vol. ii of
Mac Carthy's edition. All the editorial preface, list of contents, introduction, historical notes, codicological notes, and inconsequential variants have been omitted.
Editorial corrigenda (where relevant and well-founded) are integrated
into the electronic edition. Unnecessary or mistaken corrections by
Mac Carthy (these appear in brackets in his edition) are simply
ignored in the electronic text. Missing text supplied by the editors
in the body of the work is tagged <emph>sup</emph>. Editorial and
scribal corrections entered in the body of the work are tagged
<emph>corr</emph> and the original reading is kept in the
<emph>sic</emph> attribute. In the case of some unusual forms not
commented by the editors of the hard copy the manuscript reading is
tagged <emph>sic</emph>, without further comment by the makers of the
electronic edition. Changes of scribe, marked by the hard copy
editors, are retained and marked in the <emph>hand</emph> attribute of
the tag <emph>add</emph> using the scribal sigla (for which see
profiledesc below). Thus, scribal glosses and annotations are tagged
<emph>add</emph> with appropriate attributes. Because of the
unsatisfactory nature of Mac Carthy's edition, additions by hands
other than the main hand are simply marked with <emph>add</emph> or
<emph>addspan</emph> and the attribute <emph>late</emph>. Strictly
codicological annotations in the apparatus criticus that do not appear
to affect the meaning have been ignored.</p>
</samplingDecl>
<editorialDecl>
<correction status="medium">
<p>Text has been thoroughly checked and proofread five times. It is very difficult to create an electronic edition of a text as long, as complex, and as varied as the Annals of Ulster. There will be errors and ambiguities in this text as there are in the original editions. Readers are invited to submit corrections and emendations both of this electronic edition and of the editions on which it is based. Improved manuscript readings and corrections of scribal errors and errors of transcription and interpretation that may have escaped previous editors are also sought. Any improvements will be credited to the scholars who submit them.</p>
</correction>
<normalization>
<p>The electronic text represents an edited version of the
hard-copy editions, with some minor conventional changes.</p>
<p>Lenited <emph>f</emph> and <emph>s</emph>, rendered
<emph>f with overdot</emph> and <emph>s with overdot</emph> in the
printed text of Mac Airt and Mac Niocaill, are rendered
<emph>fh</emph> and <emph>sh</emph>. In the electronic text,
<emph>Kl.</emph> represents <emph>K&lstrok;.</emph> of the print
text. The few examples of <emph>&aelig;</emph> in the print text are
not retained since they are merely graphical. In Roman numerals,
especially common in AD dates, the suprascript <emph>o</emph> has not
been retained. In Anno Mundi dates, <emph>.iiiim</emph> represents
<emph>4000</emph>, <emph>m</emph> being a conventional representation
of the italic <emph>m</emph> of the print text, itself a conventional
representation of the overstroke of the Roman numeral.</p>
<p>Otherwise, normal CELT conventions have been applied in
regard to  text divisions, word segmentation, and capitalization in
proper names.</p>
</normalization>
<quotation>
<p>The few quotation are tagged <emph>q</emph>. Citations from
other texts, including scripture, are tagged in accordance with TEI
guidelines.</p>
</quotation>
<hyphenation>
<p>Soft hyphens are silently removed. When a hyphenated word
(hard or soft) crosses a page-break or line-break, the page-break or
line-break is marked after the completion of the hyphenated word.</p>
</hyphenation>
<segmentation>
<p><emph>div0</emph>=the whole work; <emph>div1</emph>=the individual annal (the text for a given year); <emph>div2</emph>=the individual entry in an annal, whether these are numbered in the edition (Mac Airt &amp; Mac Niocaill) or not (Mac Carthy). Passages of verse occurring within text paragraphs or within marginalia are treated as embedded texts and, where relevant, stanzas are enumerated in the structural mark-up. The page-breaks of the printed texts and the manuscript folio numbers are marked. From the beginning to 1102 only the folio and column numbers for MS 1 are given. From 1102 to 1131, where the lacunae in MS 1 are supplied from MS 2, the folio and column numbers of each manuscript are distinguished. From 1155 to the end, the folio and column numbers of each manuscript are recorded.</p>
</segmentation>
<interpretation>
<p>Names (persons, groups, dynasties, peoples, lineages, places) are tagged and distinguished. The tagging of surnames in the late tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries, when they were coming into existence, poses many serious historical problems, some of which cannot be resolved because of lack of evidence. Therefore, a degree of uncertainty attaches to many and they remain subject to correction. Offices and titles (king, lord, abbot, erenagh, coarb, lector, sage, oeconomus, etc.) are tagged. Numbers and dates are tagged. Terms (including astronomical and meteorological events) are tagged.</p>
